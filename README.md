## Motivation 

As I started to read research papers, it was messy at first when I just left downloaded pdf all over the places in my `~/Downloads` or `~/Desktop`. Naturally, I started to organize all the downloaded papers into a single directory, but I still faced an issue: How to name and organize the pdf files such that I can quickly locate a specific paper when I want to?

Usually paper comes with a long title, so it's not ideal to use the title of the paper as the filename. But if I use the paper id like `arXiv:2010.00514`, the paper folder will look very organized, but the filename carries zero information for me. 

Some papers are very well-known, such as `Resnet`, and we usually recall a certain paper either by its unique name, its unique method, its famous author, its accepted conference, or journal. But I can only organize the files into folders by a single attribute which would not be very helpful. If I do nested folders, that would be too much effort wasted. 

So I need a tool to help me:
1. Download paper from a given URL and create my personal reading to-do list and reading history.
2. Collect metadata of the paper, such as `Authors`, `Accepted Conference`, `Year of Publish`, `Code Repository`, etc.
3. Allow me to tag paper using keywords such as `resnet`, `yolov4`, `LSTM`. 
4. Allow me to search for a specific paper from my reading history by using the metadata or tags. 
5. Allow me to attach my reading notes/ comments to a paper I read.
